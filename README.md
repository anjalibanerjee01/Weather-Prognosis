# Weather-Prognosis
This includes a web application to generate radar images for weather forecasting tools that use Python and its libraries. 
Because weather data is non-linear, radar has changed an  effective way to analyze weather changes over a period of time. To simplify the search 
the data  python API was used to read meteorological data. Basically, it involves generating radar images from  given  files using Python 
language and its libraries as a tool  to simplify data, to read the  python API meteorological data were developed. Weather radar has evolved 
greatly and has played an increasingly important role in many meteorological and climatological applications. Also weather radar monitors 
major weather systems. They are also regularly used in vacation planning and other weather related activity. Radar measurements were also 
key to many important measurements to improve our understanding of the atmosphere and better weather forecasting on the scale of time and space.
We definitely need to provide image files to better predict the weather specifically. It would be supported by artificial intelligence
and machine learning accuracy can be achieved by examining these images.
